# Hardhat Example Project

## Description

This project provides a comprehensive example of using the Hardhat development environment for Ethereum smart contract development. It includes examples of contract deployment, testing, and task implementation. The repository demonstrates various features of Hardhat and how to integrate it with other tools commonly used in the ecosystem.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Yarn or npm
- Hardhat (installation instructions included below)

## Mode of Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hardhat-example.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd hardhat-example
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```
4. **Copy the environment variables file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to include your private key and other necessary environment variables.

5. **Compile the contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
6. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
7. **Run a local blockchain node:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```
8. **Deploy the contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

## Examples and Features

- **Basic Sample Project:** Demonstrates a basic Hardhat setup with sample contracts and scripts.
- **Parallel Testing:** Shows how to run tests in parallel to speed up the testing process.
- **Custom Solidity Compiler:** Example of how to use a custom version of the Solidity compiler.
- **Event Reading:** Includes scripts and tests for reading events emitted by contracts.
- **Etherscan Verification:** Instructions for verifying contracts on Etherscan.
- **Advanced Use Cases:** Integrates other tools and shows more complex examples, such as deploying to the zkSync Era network.
